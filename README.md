# HCM Right-of-Action Field

This repository does not execute.
It does not decide.
It does not trigger.

It defines the *existence* of permission for action
without enacting action itself.

Presence may reference this field.
No component may invoke through it.

This field exists to close the right of action
without breaking rhythm.
